You know as
true as trees are tall
And autumn leaves do fall
Oh, it sometimes
rains in paradise
And even the warmest
heart can turn to ice
I know it happend to us all
Every kind of people fall
And after all the tears are gone
Do we have the
heart to carry on
Here and now, still somehow
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
Still a friend of mine
you're still a friend of mine
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
<♪>
To think of all the
times I hurt you
And never thought it through
Oh, I treated you so badly baby
Could such a cruel
heart ever be free
I know it happens to us all
Every kind of people fall
Oh, and after all is
said and done
Do we have the heart to carry on
Here and now, still somehow
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
Still a friend of mine
you're still a friend of mine
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
<♪>
I know as long as I've got you
And we do the things we do
The next time baby
That our love breaks down
I'll do the best that I can
To turn it around
<♪>
Here and now, still somehow
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
Still a friend of mine
you're still a friend of mine
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
<♪>
Time and time and time again
I'm gonna be right
here for you baby
Seasons come and seasons go
Gonna be right here for you
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
<♪>
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
Still a friend of mine
oh you're still a friend of mine
<♪>
Still a friend of mine
Gonna be right here for you
