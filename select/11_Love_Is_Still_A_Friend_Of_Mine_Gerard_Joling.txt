Ah, ha, ah, ha
Baby, I've been dreaming
Thought that you were leaving
But as I open up my eyes
Ooh, I can see that
Love is still a friend of mine

Faith is here to guide us
Nothing can divide us
Knowing we will always rhyme
Ooh, I can feel that
Love is still a friend of mine

I will be there
Whenever you need me
I will be there
Whenever you call
I will be there
To share the feeling with you
Love is still a friend of mine

Compañera
Compañera

Looking for affection
Coming my direction
Everytime you gimme a sign
Oh, I believe that
Love is still a friend of mine

Every word you're saying
Girl has got me swaying
Found out after all this time
Ooh, I can feel that
Love is still a friend of mine

I will be there
Whenever you need me
I will be there
Whenever you call
I will be there
To share the feeling with you
Love is still a friend of mine

Well, we all know what's elemental
Love to life it's a fundamental
Thing we need it every day
So baby let me hear you say
(Oh, love is still a friend of mine)
Well, it fills your heart with N.R.G.
The thing we call L.O.V.E.
Passion power and the hurt
Coming all from a four letter word
(Oh, love is still a friend of mine)

I will be there
Whenever you need me
I will be there
Whenever you call
I will be there
To share the feeling with you
Love is still a friend of mine.
